Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten
Your generals after.
Sir, Mark Antony
Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.
Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
Which will become you both, farewell.
We shall,
As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount
Before you, Lepidus.
Your way is shorter;
My purposes do draw me much about:
You'll win two days upon me.
Sir, good success!
Farewell.
