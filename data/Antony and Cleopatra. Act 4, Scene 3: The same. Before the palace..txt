Brother, good night: to-morrow is the day.
It will determine one way: fare you well.
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
Nothing. What news?
Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.
Well, sir, good night.
Soldiers, have careful watch.
And you. Good night, good night.
Here we: and if to-morrow
Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
Our landmen will stand up.
'Tis a brave army,
And full of purpose.
Peace! what noise?
List, list!
Hark!
Music i' the air.
Under the earth.
It signs well, does it not?
No.
Peace, I say!
What should this mean?
'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,
Now leaves him.
Walk; let's see if other watchmen
Do hear what we do?
How now, masters!
[Speaking together]  How now!
How now! do you hear this?
Ay; is't not strange?
Do you hear, masters? do you hear?
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
Let's see how it will give off.
Content. 'Tis strange.
