Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the
violence of action hath made you reek as a
sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:
there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
[Aside]  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.
Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be
not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.
[Aside]  His steel was in debt; it went o' the
backside the town.
The villain would not stand me.
[Aside]  No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.
Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but
he added to your having; gave you some ground.
[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!
I would they had not come between us.
[Aside]  So would I, till you had measured how long
a fool you were upon the ground.
And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!
[Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election, she
is damned.
Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain
go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen
small reflection of her wit.
[Aside]  She shines not upon fools, lest the
reflection should hurt her.
Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some
hurt done!
[Aside]  I wish not so; unless it had been the fall
of an ass, which is no great hurt.
You'll go with us?
I'll attend your lordship.
Nay, come, let's go together.
Well, my lord.
