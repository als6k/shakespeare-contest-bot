Did you ever hear the like?
No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she
being once gone.
But to have divinity preached there! did you ever
dream of such a thing?
No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses:
shall's go hear the vestals sing?
I'll do any thing now that is virtuous; but I
am out of the road of rutting for ever.
