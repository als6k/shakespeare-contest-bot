Master doctor, my daughter is in green: when you
see your time, take her by the band, away with her
to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before
into the Park: we two must go together.
I know vat I have to do. Adieu.
Fare you well, sir.
My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of
Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying
my daughter: but 'tis no matter; better a little
chiding than a great deal of heart-break.
Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies, and the
Welsh devil Hugh?
They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak,
with obscured lights; which, at the very instant of
Falstaff's and our meeting, they will at once
display to the night.
That cannot choose but amaze him.
If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be
amazed, he will every way be mocked.
We'll betray him finely.
Against such lewdsters and their lechery
Those that betray them do no treachery.
The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!
